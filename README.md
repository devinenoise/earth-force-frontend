#   2. Description 
    Earth-Force Natural Events Tracker allows you to find current and
    historical natural weather related events, track and save those events,
    and connect with resources that help with disaster relief.

#   3. Problem Domain
    Everyone on the planet is impacted by natural weather events. In many cases, these events can become 
    natural disasters and have a significant impact on human and environmental health. And yet, 
    despite these impacts, these events happen with such frequency it becomes difficult to remember 
    or distinguish them over time. In an effort to help individuals connect with these periods of 
    severe weather, we wanted to build an application that helps people stay monitor these events globally.

#   6. Defined Endpoints
    Two defined get routes including a single API fetch to display natural events by category 
    and second get route pull the favorites from our database. Our post route allows users 
    to insert their tracked events into the SQL database that seeded information includes 
    the user_id, title (of the natural event), and the original date of the natural event.

#   7. Data Base Schemas
    Favorites Table
    The table rows sort by serial id (database location), title of natural event, user_id.
